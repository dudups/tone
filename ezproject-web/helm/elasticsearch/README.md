# ezone定制:
- Chart.yaml:
    - 基于https://helm.elastic.co/的7.9.3改造，修改下版本等meta信息
- values.yaml:
    - nodeSelector：选择专属node用于部署es
    - podSecurityContext：指定tcp_keepalive时间
    - image&imagePullSecrets：指定带中文分词插件的自定义es镜像以及镜像源及其secret等
    - volumeClaimTemplate：设置为本地存储，定制存储请求
    - service: nodePort等
- local-storage:
    - values.yaml+statefulset.yaml: 扩展hostPersistence配置，通过hostPath挂载；需要手工准备好hostPath目录和设置权限！！！
    - 更好的方案persistence打开+volumeClaimTemplate，但需要提前把专用分区挂载到同一父目录下去，依赖于提前统一规划好node宿主的磁盘分区

## Requirements

* [Helm][] >=2.8.0 and <3.0.0
* Kubernetes >=1.8
* Minimum cluster requirements include the following to run this chart with
default settings. All of these settings are configurable.
  * Three Kubernetes nodes to respect the default "hard" affinity settings
  * 1GB of RAM for the JVM heap

See [supported configurations][] for more details.

## Installing

This chart is tested with the latest 7.9.3 version.

### Install released version using Helm repository

* Add the Elastic Helm charts repo:
`helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co`

* Install it:
  - with Helm 2: `helm install --name elasticsearch --version <version> elastic/elasticsearch`
  - with [Helm 3 (beta)][]: `helm install elasticsearch --version <version> elastic/elasticsearch`

### Install development version from a branch

* Clone the git repo: `git clone git@github.com:elastic/helm-charts.git`

* Checkout the branch : `git checkout 7.9`

* Install it:
  - with Helm 2: `helm install --name elasticsearch --version 7.9.3 ./helm-charts/elasticsearch`
  - with [Helm 3 (beta)][]: `helm install elasticsearch --version 7.9.3 ./helm-charts/elasticsearch`

## Upgrading

Please always check [CHANGELOG.md][] and [BREAKING_CHANGES.md][] before
upgrading to a new chart version.


## Usage notes

* This repo includes a number of [examples][] configurations which can be used
as a reference. They are also used in the automated testing of this chart.
* Automated testing of this chart is currently only run against GKE (Google
Kubernetes Engine).
* The chart deploys a StatefulSet and by default will do an automated rolling
update of your cluster. It does this by waiting for the cluster health to become
green after each instance is updated. If you prefer to update manually you can
set `OnDelete` [updateStrategy][].
* It is important to verify that the JVM heap size in `esJavaOpts` and to set
the CPU/Memory `resources` to something suitable for your cluster.
* To simplify chart and maintenance each set of node groups is deployed as a
separate Helm release. Take a look at the [multi][] example to get an idea for
how this works. Without doing this it isn't possible to resize persistent
volumes in a StatefulSet. By setting it up this way it makes it possible to add
more nodes with a new storage size then drain the old ones. It also solves the
problem of allowing the user to determine which node groups to update first when
doing upgrades or changes.
* We have designed this chart to be very un-opinionated about how to configure
Elasticsearch. It exposes ways to set environment variables and mount secrets
inside of the container. Doing this makes it much easier for this chart to
support multiple versions with minimal changes.

| `antiAffinity`                     | Setting this to hard enforces the [anti-affinity][] rules. If it is set to soft it will be done "best effort". Other values will be ignored                                                                                                               | `hard`                                          |

| `enableServiceLinks`               | Set to false to disabling service links, which can cause slow pod startup times when there are many services in the current namespace.                                                                                                                    | `true`                                          |

## FAQ

### How to deploy this chart on a specific K8S distribution?

This chart is designed to run on production scale Kubernetes clusters with
multiple nodes, lots of memory and persistent storage. For that reason it can be
a bit tricky to run them against local Kubernetes environments such as
[Minikube][].

This chart is highly tested with [GKE][], but some K8S distribution also
requires specific configurations.

We provide examples of configuration for the following K8S providers:

- [Docker for Mac][]
- [KIND][]
- [Minikube][]
- [MicroK8S][]
- [OpenShift][]

### How to deploy dedicated nodes types?

All the Elasticsearch pods deployed share the same configuration. If you need to
deploy dedicated [nodes types][] (for example dedicated master and data nodes),
you can deploy multiple releases of this chart with different configurations
while they share the same `clusterName` value.

For each Helm release, the nodes types can then be defined using `roles` value.

An example of Elasticsearch cluster using 2 different Helm releases for master
and data nodes can be found in [examples/multi][].

#### Clustering and Node Discovery

This chart facilitates Elasticsearch node discovery and services by creating two
`Service` definitions in Kubernetes, one with the name `$clusterName-$nodeGroup`
and another named `$clusterName-$nodeGroup-headless`.
Only `Ready` pods are a part of the `$clusterName-$nodeGroup` service, while all
pods ( `Ready` or not) are a part of `$clusterName-$nodeGroup-headless`.

If your group of master nodes has the default `nodeGroup: master` then you can
just add new groups of nodes with a different `nodeGroup` and they will
automatically discover the correct master. If your master nodes have a different
`nodeGroup` name then you will need to set `masterService` to
`$clusterName-$masterNodeGroup`.

The chart value for `masterService` is used to populate
`discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts` , which Elasticsearch nodes will use to
contact master nodes and form a cluster.
Therefore, to add a group of nodes to an existing cluster, setting
`masterService` to the desired `Service` name of the related cluster is
sufficient.

### How to deploy clusters with security (authentication and TLS) enabled?

This Helm chart can use existing [Kubernetes secrets][] to setup
credentials or certificates for examples. These secrets should be created
outside of this chart and accessed using [environment variables][] and volumes.

An example of Elasticsearch cluster using security can be found in
[examples/security][].

### How to migrate from helm/charts stable chart?

If you currently have a cluster deployed with the [helm/charts stable][] chart
you can follow the [migration guide][].

### How to install OSS version of Elasticsearch?

Deploying OSS version of Elasticsearch can be done by setting `image` value to
[Elasticsearch OSS Docker image][]

An example of Elasticsearch cluster using OSS version can be found in
[examples/oss][].

### How to install plugins?

The recommended way to install plugins into our Docker images is to create a
[custom Docker image][].

The Dockerfile would look something like:

```
ARG elasticsearch_version
FROM docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:${elasticsearch_version}

RUN bin/elasticsearch-plugin install --batch repository-gcs
```

And then updating the `image` in values to point to your custom image.

There are a couple reasons we recommend this.

1. Tying the availability of Elasticsearch to the download service to install
plugins is not a great idea or something that we recommend. Especially in
Kubernetes where it is normal and expected for a container to be moved to
another host at random times.
2. Mutating the state of a running Docker image (by installing plugins) goes
against best practices of containers and immutable infrastructure.

### How to use the keystore?

#### Basic example

Create the secret, the key name needs to be the keystore key path. In this
example we will create a secret from a file and from a literal string.

```
kubectl create secret generic encryption-key --from-file=xpack.watcher.encryption_key=./watcher_encryption_key
kubectl create secret generic slack-hook --from-literal=xpack.notification.slack.account.monitoring.secure_url='https://hooks.slack.com/services/asdasdasd/asdasdas/asdasd'
```

To add these secrets to the keystore:

```
keystore:
  - secretName: encryption-key
  - secretName: slack-hook
```

#### Multiple keys

All keys in the secret will be added to the keystore. To create the previous
example in one secret you could also do:

```
kubectl create secret generic keystore-secrets --from-file=xpack.watcher.encryption_key=./watcher_encryption_key --from-literal=xpack.notification.slack.account.monitoring.secure_url='https://hooks.slack.com/services/asdasdasd/asdasdas/asdasd'
```

```
keystore:
  - secretName: keystore-secrets
```

#### Custom paths and keys

If you are using these secrets for other applications (besides the Elasticsearch
keystore) then it is also possible to specify the keystore path and which keys
you want to add. Everything specified under each `keystore` item will be passed
through to the `volumeMounts` section for mounting the [secret][]. In this
example we will only add the `slack_hook` key from a secret that also has other
keys. Our secret looks like this:

```
kubectl create secret generic slack-secrets --from-literal=slack_channel='#general' --from-literal=slack_hook='https://hooks.slack.com/services/asdasdasd/asdasdas/asdasd'
```

We only want to add the `slack_hook` key to the keystore at path
`xpack.notification.slack.account.monitoring.secure_url`:

```
keystore:
  - secretName: slack-secrets
    items:
    - key: slack_hook
      path: xpack.notification.slack.account.monitoring.secure_url
```

You can also take a look at the [config example][] which is used as part of the
automated testing pipeline.

### How to enable snapshotting?

1. Install your [snapshot plugin][] into a custom Docker image following the
[how to install plugins guide][].
2. Add any required secrets or credentials into an Elasticsearch keystore
following the [how to use the keystore][] guide.
3. Configure the [snapshot repository][] as you normally would.
4. To automate snapshots you can use [Snapshot Lifecycle Management][] or a tool
like [curator][].

### How to configure templates post-deployment?

You can use `postStart` [lifecycle hooks][] to run code triggered after a
container is created.

Here is an example of `postStart` hook to configure templates:

```yaml
lifecycle:
  postStart:
    exec:
      command:
        - bash
        - -c
        - |
          #!/bin/bash
          # Add a template to adjust number of shards/replicas
          TEMPLATE_NAME=my_template
          INDEX_PATTERN="logstash-*"
          SHARD_COUNT=8
          REPLICA_COUNT=1
          ES_URL=http://localhost:9200
          while [[ "$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' $ES_URL)" != "200" ]]; do sleep 1; done
          curl -XPUT "$ES_URL/_template/$TEMPLATE_NAME" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'{"index_patterns":['\""$INDEX_PATTERN"\"'],"settings":{"number_of_shards":'$SHARD_COUNT',"number_of_replicas":'$REPLICA_COUNT'}}'
```
